# PwC-Internship
Diversity and Inclusion

Task-1 : Define relevant KPIs in hiring, promotion, performance, and turnover, and create a visualization.

Here are the KPIs defined:

*Hiring
*Promotions
*Turnover
*Employee Average Performance Rating
*Top 3 Job Profile Gender Balance
*Employees by Age Groups

Task-2 : Write what you think some root causes of their slow progress might be.

* *Higher Turnover Among Female Employees.* The higher turnover percentage among female employees suggests that there may be factors leading to dissatisfaction or challenges specific to female employeesâ€™ experiences within the company. This could include issues related to work-life balance, workplace culture, or career advancement opportunities.
* The observation that there are *more male employees in higher-level job profiles* indicates that there may be systemic barriers or a lack of support for female employees to progress into leadership positions.
* *Higher promotions of females in the Junior Officer profile but at the top level profile female promotion is lower.* This may be connected to performance rating, lack of support, and training to improve performance.
